![LMS Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200/4a86e8/ffffff?text=Learning+Management+System)

## 📚 Project Overview

The Learning Management System (LMS) is a comprehensive C++ application designed to manage educational institutions' resources, courses, students, faculty, and activities. This object-oriented solution provides an integrated platform for tracking academic processes and enhancing the educational experience.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **User Management**: Register and manage students and faculty with detailed profiles
- **Course Management**: Create, update, and assign courses with enrollment tracking
- **Department Organization**: Structure departments with assigned faculty and courses
- **Assignment System**: Create, distribute, and grade assignments with automated tracking
- **Club & Event Management**: Organize extracurricular activities and student clubs
- **Library Resources**: Track book borrowing and returns with availability status
- **Attendance Tracking**: Record and monitor student attendance for courses
- **Feedback Collection**: Gather student feedback on courses and instruction
- **Grade Management**: Record and report student performance metrics

## 🧩 Class Structure

The project follows object-oriented principles with a robust class hierarchy:

```
user (Base Class)
├── student
└── faculty

course
department
club
event
assignment
enrollment
grade
libraryresources
attendance
feedback
project
```

## 💻 Technical Implementation

- **Language**: C++11 with Standard Template Library
- **Storage**: File-based persistence system for data management
- **Architecture**: Object-oriented design with inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism
- **UI**: Console-based user interface with colored output and animations
- **Cross-platform**: Works on both Windows and Linux/Unix systems
